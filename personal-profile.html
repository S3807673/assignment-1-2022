    <h2>What do the results of this test mean for you?</h2>

    <p>The Myer-Briggs test resulted in an Advocate (INFJ-A)  personality type. One of the “rarest personality types in the world”, the -A stands for “assertive” - which is of no surprise to me. I have been told that I am an assertive individual - I do what I say I’m going to do and do it well (Or strive to). My overall test results included:</p>

    <ol>

      <li>Introverted(64%)</li>
      <li>Intuitive (73%)</li>
      <li>Feeling(61%)</li>
      <li>Judging(64%)</li>
      <li>Assertive(81%)</li>

    </ol>

    <p>Furthermore, I am listed under the <em>diplomat</em> role which means I care greatly for people & connecting with people - When I’m comfortable. It means I’m also willing to cooperate as a team rather than compete with those around me. I would much rather get things done at or above the level of expectation working efficiently with my other team members.
    I enjoy listening to everyone’s thoughts, opinions and ideas as well as also giving my own thoughts and ideas. I also understand that people are still individuals with different thoughts, ideas and beliefs & that may affect the way they contribute to the team - But I always believe that they’re always trying their best to be helpful & intuitive. People work differently and that’s completely okay! </p>

    <p>In a team setting I don’t necessarily enjoy being the “leader” - Maybe, not in everything. I think I would enjoy people leading in their strengths when working in a team. Individuals may appoint me as the leader of said team at first - Due to my confidence & assertiveness, however that is not something that I would like to be when working as a team. I think I may help other team members & figure out with the rest of the team all of our personal strengths and weaknesses. In turn, I will be comfortable in the role appointed to me by others or myself, but also be confident that other team members will put in equal effort. I will strive to not be over-assertive, thoughtful & unbiased.</p>

    <p>With this said, I would try and form a team with different personality traits that can provide a completely different point of view from myself but also have individual characteristics that can help make the team feel “whole”. My 16personalities results of INFJ-A are accurate & eye opening. It has helped me in understanding myself</p>

    <h2 style=" text-align: right;">What do the results of this test mean for you?</h2>

    <p>In terms of Learning Style my scores are the following</p>

        <li>Auditory(45%)</li>
        <li>Visual(25%)</li>
        <li>Tactile(30%)</li>


      <p>I am an Auditory learner, which means the best way for me to learn and retain information is by hearing and listening to the information being taught to me. I also tend to speak to myself to try and remember things, over and over again until it is stored in my long term memory. I also tend to say things with a certain rhythm (in my head, of course), as I remember rhythms a lot easier. I personally think this skill comes from being a piano player/dancer. However, because I am a   little  bit introverted as stated by 16Personalities test, I don’t enjoy talking to others when I’m bored. Focussing on the information at hand helps me with boredom.
       According to my Education Planner Learning Styles test, constantly reading out loud to myself and others, and recording myself is the best way for me to retain information and learn!
      To conclude, RMIT weekly lectures are golden for me.</p>
