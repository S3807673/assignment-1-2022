       <h2>What do the results of this test mean for you</h2>

       <p>My creativity test results were the following scores:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>59-80</li>
         </ul>
      <p>Out of three different categories</p>
        <ul>
          <li>16-36</li>
          <li>37-58</li>
          <li><strong>59-80</strong></li>

        </ul>
      <p>I have scored in the highest percentile.  Creativity for me is one of my strengths, especially designing (Or trying to) and ideas when it comes to presentations  alongside music being used for added effects, what type of font is being used & the overall style any group presentation is very important to me. I would love to learn how to use CSS in a way that makes a presentation or even a website interactive.</p>
