    <h2 style="color: white; font-size: 35px;">Who am I?</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">Well... I'm Adrien. Full name: Adrien Samuel Guillaume (<em>So... french</em>) Aliphon.

      <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">I'm 23 years old.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 16px; color: white;">Let's not talk about that.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">I was born on the 7th of May, 1999. Born on a <em>little</em> tropical island called Mauritius,
    I immigrated to Australia in 2007, whereby I attended primary school, high school and now university. At first, it was difficult to adapt as my first language was french. However, within 6-8 months I slowly started using English and only spoke french if my grandparents were here on holidays.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white">After graduating year 12 in 2017, I was offered a scholarship to LaTrobe university which was amazing. Having to decline as I had a change of mind, I decided to take a break to really figure out what I wanted for myself and my future. I worked for multiple companies doing multiple different jobs, gaining experience in different fields to really help me figure out what is it that I enjoyed. Information technology was always my go-to but as a teenager just graduating school how could I be so sure? It's now 2022, and this is definitely what I would love to do! Finally having a plan set for my life <em>(only taken 4 years)</em>, I'm extremely excited to be here and to be learning. A fun fact about myself would be that I can play the piano <em>really, really</em> well. </p>

    <h2 style="color: white; font-size: 35px;">What are my interests?</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">My interest in I.T sparked when my mum first handed me her laptop back in 2007 (Was 8 at the time) whereby I found myself a game called “Runescape” through a google search. I enjoy high fantasy, MMORPG’s and I’ve been an avid gamer since the <strong>ripe</strong> age of 8. This passion for games continued throughout my teenage years and eventually led to an interest in Game Development.

      <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">Around the same time I also had an interest in the Army & the Australian Secret Service. Combining both of these interests and their relevant fields I came to one conclusion: Cybersecurity (With the very limited knowledge that I had). Shortly after, La Trobe University released a video in 2017 named “Inside the Mind of a Hacker: Intro to the Dark Web” which introduced the levels that came with both I.T and Cybersecurity. I was immediately inspired to be a part of this field.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">As I had my heart set on Information Technology (Cybersecurity), I decided to research a little bit more on which universities were well known for the I.T course. Of course, RMIT came up in both my searches and on forums run by previous students. In the end, RMIT constantly portrayed exactly what I was looking for - Perfect location, a great university culture & people, a great curriculum for learning. Furthermore, I expect RMIT to give me the best possible education I can receive on Information Tech, from the basics to the more advanced sections. I expect to learn how to code, program and ethically hack.</p>
